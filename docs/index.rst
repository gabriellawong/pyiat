pyiat |release|
=================

pyiat analyzes data from the Implicit Association Test (IAT) consistent with the standard IAT scoring algorithm (Greenwald et al., 2003) and Brief IAT scoring algorithm (Nosek et al., 2014)

Features
--------

pyiat currently supports:

* Analysis of the IAT and Brief IAT (BIAT) 
* IAT can be analyzed with weighted or unweighted algorithm
* BIAT can include 1, 2, or 3 blocks 
* Can obtain D scores for each stimulus (word)
* Output includes overall error percentage as well as error percentages by block (if using a weighted score) and by condition 
* Same output (overall, by block, by condition) for trials considered too fast or too slow
* Can set reaction time for trials considered too fast or too slow
* Can set cutoffs for error\too fast\too slow flags indiciating that a participant is excluded for poor performance
* Can print output to Excel
